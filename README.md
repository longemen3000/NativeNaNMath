# NativeNaNMath

[![Build Status](https://github.com/longemen3000/NativeNaNMath.jl/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/longemen3000/NativeNaNMath.jl/actions)

Proof of concept of alternative approach to [NaNMath.jl](https://github.com/mlubin/NaNMath.jl), by using the functions available in Base instead of the Libm ones.

It should be a drop-in replacement for NaNMath.jl
